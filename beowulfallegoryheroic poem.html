                            <p class="blog-desc">Allegory: Allegory is a form of extended metaphor in which objects and persons within a narrative are equated with meanings that lie outside the narrative. It is a type of writing that has hidden meanings, usually political or moral ones. According to J.D. Cuddon the term allegory is “any writing in verse or prose that has a double meaning”. Beowulf was passed down in the oral tradition, meaning, at first, it was a story people told each other. Between the 8th and 11th centuries in England, it was finally written down. However, it was set in Scandinavia, and the story takes place around the 6th century. It's commonly accepted that Beowulf began as a pagan tale. Over time, it was altered to include undertones of Christianity. By looking at it in this light, one can see several allegories of Christianity in Beowulf's adventures.
Beowulf’s story is somewhat of an allegory in which most of the characters have an allegorical meaning.  For example, Wiglaf represents hope, Grendel represents evil, the thief represents greed or sin, and Hrothgar represents unity and Beowulf himself is depicted as the Christ figure. There are also allegorical settings in Beowulf, such as the meadhalls representing unity and the lake representing evil or hell. The lake is a very obvious example of allegory. The lake is the home of Grendel and Grendel’s mother. Those two characters represent the devil; therefore it seems right that their home represents hell.
The theme of Beowulf is a contrast of good and evil which is manifest in both Christian and pagan elements; Beowulf represents good, while Grendel, his mother, and the dragon represent evil. The first monster our hero, Beowulf, faces is Grendel. Grendel is said to be a descendant of Cain. Cain is the son of Eve, the woman who bore sin into the world. A connection, however vague, can be made between the maternal relations of Eve and Cain and Grendel and his mother. Grendel’s mother can be considered to personify man’s fall from grace and Grendel himself might embody sin. 
These slayings are also part of his life and ministry. Christ, as we are told in the Gospel of Luke, cast demons out of Mary Magdalene and other people. He freed them of their sins and demons. Beowulf, in a way, does this to the Danish state. The Danes were under the attacks of sin and evil manifest in the monster Grendel. When Beowulf kills Grendel, he is exorcising one demon from the Danes, much as Christ did with Mary Magdalene. Beowulf than defeats Grendel’s mother, another manifestation of sin and evil, under the water in her cave. Again, Beowulf frees the Danes from sin and evil much as the ministry of Christ did.
In religious art, the devil is often represented as a dragon or serpent. Beowulf seeking out to kill the dragon is much like the mission of Christ to go out and kill the triumph of sin. In addition, Christ was betrayed by Judas for earthly profit. The thane stole from the dragon for the value of the chalice. Both Beowulf and Christ were betrayed by those close to them for temporal items. When Beowulf sought out the dragon, he said he would slay it alone but brought his twelve thanes with him. Beowulf engaged the dragon and was nearly defeated. Wiglaf, one of the thanes, called to the other to be close to Beowulf in his time of need. The other eleven were scared and ran off to hide. Wiglaf, a symbol for Saint John, went to Beowulf’s side. This is much like what happened at the time of Christ arrest and crucifixion. Of the twelve apostles, all but Saint John left Christ on the cross out of fear of death. Beowulf mortally wound the Dragon and he also lost his life as he was poisoned by the dragon. Beowulf saves Geatland just the way Christ saved humanity by giving up his life and taking all human’s sin with him.
This allegorical reading, on first sight, breaks down at and after the resurrection. However, on closer inspection it holds true. The letters of Paul and the Revelation of John demonstrates that the early Church was having problems after Christ left. John in his letters to the seven churches in Revelation tells them to stay true to the teachings of Christ. This is much like what happened in Geatland after the death of Beowulf. Many of the people failed to obey what Beowulf left for the Geats. Soon they were taken over by other tribes, similar the churches were taken over by the influences of the world. 
The religious convictions of the author of the surviving manuscript of the epic Beowulf influence the poem with symbols to the life, death and resurrection of Christ. There are symbols in the numbers, the monsters and the actions. Beowulf is easily a Christian allegory.
Beowulf: Heroic Poem:- 
The Anglo – Saxon heroic poems are vivid description of the battles and struggles, yet, they are allegorical in the inner interpretation to the fight between good and evil, between humanity and the destructive forces and the Wyrd or forces of nature. The imageries in these poems are full of artistry and poetic inspirations for the English poets of next generations. Beowulf is a saga of primitive race-their values, morals, loyalty, sacrifice, fearlessness, courtesy, tolerance and heroism. It is an experience of primitive people marching towards a civilized people. 
Beowulf, heroic poem, the highest achievement of Old English literature and the earliest European vernacular epic. Preserved in a single manuscript ( Novell Codex manuscript ), from c. 1000, it deals with events of the early 6th century and is believed to have been composed between 700 and 750. It did not appear in print until 1815. However, William Lawrence sees Beowulf's final fight as an act of "heroism that springs not only form valor but from consciousness of virtue, and from faith in the True God." 
Beowulf is a hero of the Geats and he battles against three antagonists. One is Grendel, a monster who has been attacking the resident warriors of the Royal mead hall in Denmark. The other two is Grendel’s mother and a dragon. The last battle, against the dragon, takes place later in life, after that Beowulf has returned to the land of the Geats and has become a king. In the final battle, Beowulf is fatally wounded. After his death his retainers bury him in a large mound in Geatland.
In Germanic societies, such as the one in which Beowulf takes place, there were heroic codes which defined how a noble person should act. The heroic code was of great importance in warrior societies. The poem depicts a Germanic warrior society, in which the relationship between the lord of the region and those who served under him was of paramount importance. When a warrior vowed loyalty to his lord, he became not so much his servant as his voluntary companion, one who would take pride in defending him and fighting in his wars. In return, the lord was expected to take care of his thanes (those who served him) and to reward them richly for their valour. This society was typical for the Migration period (350-550 AD) in Southern Scandinavia.
Beowulf exhibits these qualities in the Old English epic poem named after him. His heroic qualities were courage, loyalty, wisdom, boasting, and physical strength. A hero of the Geats in Sweden, Beowulf renders aid to the King of the Danes, Hrothgar. Hrothgar's mead hall has been attacked by Grendel, a powerful monster, and his mother. Beowulf heroically slays Grendel and becomes the target of his mother. Beowulf again succeeds in battle and then returns to Geatland, his home. Courage allowed Beowulf to face the monsters and gave him fame throughout the lands.
Anglo-Saxon epic heroes are willing to put their own lives in danger for the greater good. They provide the common people with a sense of security and they display honor in every act. Beowulf is willing to put himself in danger, and he accepts the challenge of fighting the monster, Grendel, for the honor of helping the Geats and to honor his father who pledged his allegiance to Hrothgar after a feud had been settled. Lines 73-4 explain his motivation: "Living his life-days, his Lord may face, And find defence in his Father’s embrace!" This act displays Beowulf's strong sense of duty, another heroic characteristic.
Later in life, Beowulf becomes King of the Geats and is responsible for guiding his kingdom. During his 50-year rule, the kingdom is attacked by a dragon whose treasure was stolen. Beowulf and his servants, the thanes, attack the dragon but they cannot defeat him. The thanes retreat for safety, except for Wiglaf and Beowulf who display another characteristic of an epic hero, bravery, when they face the dragon on their own. "Not one foot's space will if flee from the monster," boasts Beowulf. He manages to slay the dragon, but he is wounded in battle when the dragon bites him on the neck and its poisonous venom kills the mighty hero.
Following his death, the beloved Beowulf is buried on a cliff, which overlooks the sea. Along with Beowulf, the dragon's treasure - once thought to be used to benefit his people - is buried in the barrow, in accordance with Wiglaf's instructions. The warriors failed to support their king in battle, and they have been foolish to risk their most prized king, who could protect them and ensure their safety. Beowulf's subjects mourn his death, “They said that of all the kings upon the earth/ he was the man most gracious and fair-minded,/kindest to his people and keenest to win fame”.    But even in death, Beowulf protects his people - sparing them from a curse tied to the treasures. The noble funeral that Beowulf receives pays honor to his his heroic acts, befitting a king and savior.
