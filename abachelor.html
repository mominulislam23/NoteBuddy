                            <p class="blog-desc">“A Bachelor’s Complaint of the Behavior of Married People” was first published in 1823 in Charles Lamb’s (1775-1834) essay collection “Essays of Elia”. This essay has a mock serious or Pseudo serious tone and it is written in an argumentative style. Charles Lamb’s essay “A Bachelor’s Complaint of the Behavior of Married People” is just what the title suggests: it is indeed a bachelor’s complaint of the behavior of married People.
Lamb emphasizes his single status in the start of the essay “As a single man” and in doing so, separates himself from the “Married People.” He talks about Married People as if they are despicable and offensive and gives both hypothetical and personal examples to back up his points. Married People set themselves apart in their own groups through their attitudes. They really do seem to be off in their own little world of love, and this is what Lamb dislikes. He believes that Married People “prefer one another to all the world” and openly flaunt it, thus offending singles such as Lamb by implying that they “are not the object of this preference”. Furthermore, Lamb believes that overall, singles are looked down on Married People are undoubtedly more favored and knowledgeable. The main complaint that Lamb is making throughout the whole essay is the Married People’s attitudes and how they demonstrate their status. Towards the end of the essay, Lamb brings up the subject of children and how they also contribute to the Married People’s attitudes. He brings out all the negative aspects of children and emphasizes them by listing them continuously with dashes as separation. By using the negative aspects of children, he furthers his disapproval of Married People and their actions.
Lamb’s purpose in writing “A Bachelor’s Complaint of the Behavior of Married People” is to bring to attention the attitudes of Married People. He wishes for his audience to realize how Married People subconsciously flaunt themselves in their love, offending those who are single. Ultimately, he hopes that Married People will bring themselves to correct their mistakes and be more considerate towards others. He structures his argument by stating his main reason for decrying Married People is because he believes them to be overly involved with each other and their love that they disregard and “perk it up in the faces of [singles] so shamelessly”. From this claim, Lamb offers personal anecdotes as well as hypothetical situations that illustrate and support his points. He concludes his essay stating that although he despises their attitudes, he is still willing to “forgive their jealousy and dispense with toying with their brats” but thinks it “unreasonable to be called upon to love them”. Through Lamb’s willingness to forgive these people whom he disapproves of, he is seen to be credible with good values and his readers are more inclined to believe his words and work to correct the attitudes of Married People.
The structure of Lamb’s argument logically appeals to his readers, for it flows and flows and clarifies his points through examples. However, Lamb fails to address any possible counterarguments. His argument addresses only the negative aspects of Married People, but surely there are positive sides as well. By failing to address and disprove these possibilities, Lamb leaves room for doubt. Despite this, his argument stands strong, the examples he gives are cogent and, through his personal anecdotes, he is able to establish a connection with the audience. He also appeals emotionally especially to the singles, for he is a bachelor himself. The injustice that he sometimes feels can appeal to others who have felt the same way.  
Although there are some flaws in his arguments, they are overlooked and undermined by his credibility and emotional appeal. Overall, “A Bachelor’s Complaint of the Behavior of Married People” is effectively portrayed through Lamb’s arguments and claims. His complaints are easy to understand because of the examples that he gives. He makes many good points about Married People, and most likely is able to persuade many readers of his views.
